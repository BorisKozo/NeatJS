Totally not optimize! It's just me trying to get into NeuroEvolution Algorithms.

# Examples
#### Classification
Using an evolutionary process we eventually get a network that can identify whenever a point is on one side or the other of the line.

#### Pole Balancing
Pole balancing is a control benchmark historically used in engineering. It involves a pole affixed to a cart via a joint which allows movement along a single axis. The cart is able to move along a track of fixed length. Using the Neat Algorithm, we can evolve a network to control the cart. [Here it is!](https://gabrieltavernini.github.io/NeatJS/Examples/PoleBalancing/)


#### Target Seeking
In this example, we have four different populations, and each population evolves independently and at the end of each generation the best population on average score gets a point. The purpose of each player is to stay in the circle as long as possible. [Check it out!](https://gabrieltavernini.github.io/NeatJS/Examples/TargetSeeking/)
